# Basic Examples

### Record Operations
`rec-operations.php` gives an example of record level operations such as get(),
remove(), touch(), exists(), and put() with various policy options set
(Aerospike::OPT\_POLICY\_GEN, Aerospike::OPT\_POLICY\_EXISTS). An example of
identifying a record using its digest (the server's hash of the key) is given.

```bash
php rec-operations.php --host=192.168.119.3 -a -c
```

### Bin Operations
`bin-operations.php` gives an example of modifying a record with bin operations
such as prepend(), append(), increment(), and removeBin(). It also contains an
example of multi-ops, which allows for multiple bin operations to be executed at
once on a record.

```bash
php bin-operations.php --host=192.168.119.3 -a -c
```

### Batch Operations
`batch-operations.php` gives an example of the multi-key batch operations
getMany() and existsMany() that retrieve multiple records or their metadata
based on an array of keys.

```bash
php batch-operations.php --host=192.168.119.3 -a -c
```
